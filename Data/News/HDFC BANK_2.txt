HDFC Bank, India’s largest private bank, has reported a net profit of Rs 16,511 crore for the January-March quarter (Q4) of the financial year 2023-24, marking a 0.84 per cent jump compared to Rs 16,373 crore clocked in the December quarter and a 37.1 per cent rise from Rs 12,050 crore in the same period of last year.

However, the bank’s year-on-year financial results are not comparable due to the merger with the parent entity HDFC Ltd during the year.

The board of directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 19.5 per equity share of Rs one for the year ended March 2024.

The board also cleared raising of perpetual debt Instruments (part of additional Tier I capital) and Tier II Capital Bonds up to a total amount of Rs 60,000 crore over the period of next twelve months through private placement mode.
