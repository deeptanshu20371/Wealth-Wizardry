1/11 A personal loan is an unsecured loan that requires no collateral. Good credit scores make it easier to get personal loans quickly. You could apply for a personal loan if you need money for emergency purposes such as sudden and uninsured medical expenses, situations arising out of job loss, and so on. Be cautious though; interest rates on personal loans are high. It's easier to get a loan, but if you miss your Equated Monthly Instalments or worse, fail to repay principal, your debt balloons, credit score becomes bad, and you face the wrath of debt collectors. It is better to redeem from low-yield or dud investments for emergency needs.
