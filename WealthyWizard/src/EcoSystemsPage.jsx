      <p>Financial literacy can prevent devastating financial mistakes: Floating rate loans may have different interest rates each month, while traditional individual retirement account (IRA) contributions can’t be withdrawn until retirement. For someone unaware of these and other financial facts, seemingly innocent financial decisions may have long-term implications that cost them money or impact life plans. Financial literacy helps individuals avoid making mistakes with their personal finances.
        Financial literacy prepares people for financial emergencies: Topics such as saving or emergency preparedness get individuals ready for uncertain times. Though losing a job or having a major unexpected expense can be financially impactful, an individual can cushion the blow by saving regularly.
        Financial literacy can help individuals reach their goals: By better understanding how to budget and save money, individuals can create plans that define expectations, hold them accountable to their finances, and set a course for achieving important financial goals. Though someone may not be able to afford a dream today, they can create a plan that can help make it happen.
        Financial literacy gives rise to confidence: Imagine having to make a life-changing financial decision without all the necessary information. With knowledge about finances, individuals can approach major life choices with greater confidence. They'll be more likely to achieve the outcome they desire and less likely to be surprised or negatively impacted by unforeseen outcomes.</p>
